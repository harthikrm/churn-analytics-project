# SaaS Churn & Retention Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes subscription, usage, and customer behavior data from a fictional SaaS company to understand user growth, engagement, retention, and churn patterns. The objective is to surface actionable insights that can inform product, marketing, and retention strategies.

The project is intentionally developed in phases to mirror real-world analytics work, starting from data understanding and metric definition, and evolving into deeper analysis and business recommendations.

---

## Business Context
The company operates on a subscription-based SaaS model with multiple pricing tiers and a diverse customer base. Recent concerns around slowing growth and increasing churn have prompted leadership to seek a clearer understanding of:
- How users engage with the product
- When and why customers churn
- Which segments contribute most to revenue and risk

This analysis supports decision-making for product, customer success, and leadership teams.

---

## Key Questions (Evolving)
The analysis aims to answer questions such as:
- How has the active customer base changed over time?
- What does retention look like across different signup cohorts?
- Which subscription plans and customer segments drive the most revenue?
- Are certain product usage patterns associated with higher churn?
- Is there a relationship between support activity and customer churn?

These questions will be refined as data exploration progresses.

## Dataset
The project uses a multi-table SaaS dataset containing:
- Customer account information
- Subscription lifecycle and revenue data
- Feature usage and engagement logs
- Support ticket activity
- Payment and billing records

The dataset is treated as a realistic representation of production SaaS data, including incomplete fields and ambiguous definitions.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – data exploration, joins, and metric calculations  
- **Python** – exploratory analysis, cohort analysis, and deeper segmentation  
- **Tableau / Data Visualization** – executive dashboards and storytelling (planned)

## Project Status
**In Progress**

Current phase:
- Data understanding
- Business question definition

## Notes
- Assumptions made during analysis are documented in `docs/assumptions_and_notes.md`
- This project prioritizes clarity, reproducibility, and business relevance over model complexity
